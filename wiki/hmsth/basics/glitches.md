# StH Glitches and Exploits

StH is not super glitch-heavy compared to other HM/SoS speedgames (though we are always hoping for something crazy to be found), but there are a couple small exploits that are extremely important for speedruns.

## Weed Intro

This topic is covered briefly in the [basic affection](basics/affection/md) article, but it's worth discussing in detail here. Every villager has a special conversation boost for their first interaction of the year, called an **introduction**. For most villagers, if the player is holding an item during the introduction, the intro counts for an extra +2, called a **gift intro**. Despite the name, the held item **does not need to be a liked item**. The gift intro boost will be applied regardless, but the villager will still take or leave the item depending on whether it is a liked item (physically removing it from the player's hands if it is liked). If the villager takes the item, it counts as the daily gift and they cannot be gifted again, but if they don't take it, **they can still be gifted that day**. Because weeds are the most common disliked gift, this trick is commonly called a **weed intro**.

This is notable because most gifts in StH are +4, so the normal gift intro is usually not useful. As an example, Bob's normal intro is +12, and his gift intro is +14. If a gift intro is triggered with a liked item, say a Very Berry, he will get +14, but he cannot be gifted again that day. On the other hand, if he is intro'd *and then gifted the Very Berry*, he will receive 12 + 4 = +16 total affection. Indeed, this is normally the best strat, unless the extra +2 won't end up mattering in the long run. However, if the weed intro is used, he will receive +14 for his gift intro, *but he can still be gifted normally*, giving him 14 + 4 = +18 total affection.

Weeds grow at random wherever an herb could otherwise appear. They are common enough that this is a viable strategy if it can help save an interaction in the long run. Notably, any item that the villager won't accept will work for a weed intro, even neutral (+0) items, such as Moondrop Flowers for many of the male villagers.

Dia, Kurt, Parsley, and Ronald receive no extra boost for a gift intro, meaning that an attempted gift intro effectively "eats" the daily gift. A weed intro in there case would be exactly equivalent to a normal intro plus a gift.
