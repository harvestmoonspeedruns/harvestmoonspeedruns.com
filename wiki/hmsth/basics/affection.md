# StH Affection

The affection system in StH is similar to other early HM titles, but it also has its fair share of intricacies, especially regarding the conversation system. This page will cover the basics of **introduction**, **conversation**, and **gift** boosts, as well as affection boosts from the **Harvest Goddess questions** and certain **cutscenes**. As a rule, StH limits each villager to **one gift and one conversation per day**, but there are exceptions which will be discussed below.

## Goddess Questions

Upon starting any fresh file (by selecting "New Game" on the title screen), a cutscene with the Harvest Goddess will play where she tasks the player with saving the town. In this cutscene, she will ask three questions, each with a **positive** response and a **negative** response. These questions are:

  1. "A puppy has been abandoned in the rain. What would you do?"
     * Take him home (POSITIVE)
     * Ignore (NEGATIVE)
  2. "Someone has thrown trash on the ground. What would you do?"
     * Pick up (POSITIVE)
     * Ignore (NEGATIVE)
  3. "You've found someone else's money on the ground. What would you do?"
     * Turn it in (POSITIVE)
     * Take it home (NEGATIVE)

The **positive** response is always the first option, the **negative** always the second. Depending on the player's responses to these questions, a **+15 affection boost** will be given to each of a different group of villagers. This boost only applies to the first year of the file, as the opening Goddess cutscene does not play for any subsequent New Game+ years. The response patterns are **all positive**, **all negative**, or **mixed** (any combination of at least one positive and at least one negative response). The villager groups are as follows:

  * POSITIVE: Dia, Bob, Nak, Kurt, Louis
  * NEGATIVE: Katie, Gina, Nic, Joe
  * MIXED: Lyla, Gwen, Tim, Flak

Wallace, Woody, Ronald, Parsley, and Martha are not affected by any response pattern, so they always start with 0 affection.

Because the Goddess questions are only available on a fresh file, they can only be used in any% speedruns. The strategy is to give the response pattern that will boost whatever villager is the main target for the ending being attempted, e.g., for any% Horse Race, the **positive** pattern can be used to boost Bob, for any% Endangered Weasel, the **mixed** pattern can be used to boost Gwen, etc.

## Introductions

An **introduction** is the first interaction with a given villager in a given year. Because New Game+ "resets the timeline" in StH, all villagers will start again at 0 affection and treat the player as if they had never met. The introduction boost varies for every villager and can also vary depending on whether the player is holding an item during this first interaction, called a **gift intro**; a few villagers gain no extra boost from the gift intro as compared with the normal intro (Dia, Kurt, Parsley, and Ronald). The introduction counts as the conversation boost for the day (but see the "Doubletalk" section below).

The introduction boosts for all villagers are given below.


| Villager | Intro | Gift Intro |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Bob | 12 | 14 |
| Dia | 8 | 8 |
| Flak | 10 | 12 |
| Gina | 8 | 10 |
| Gwen | 12 | 14 |
| Joe | 8 | 10 |
| Katie | 10 | 12 |
| Kurt | 10 | 10 |
| Louis | 12 | 14 |
| Lyla | 10 | 12 |
| Martha | 10 | 12 |
| Nak | 10 | 12 |
| Nic | 10 | 12 |
| Parsley | 10 | 10 |
| Ronald | 12 | 12 |
| Tim | 12 | 14 |
| Wallace | 10 | 12 |
| Woody | 10 | 12 |

For a gift intro, the player may choose to hold *any item whatsoever*, whether or not it is a liked or disliked gift for the villager in question. If it is a liked gift, the villager will take the item from the player, as they would for a normal gift interaction, and this will count as the daily gift. Interestingly, if it is a disliked gift, the gift intro boost will still be granted, but the villager will not take the item from the player, meaning that **it will not count as the daily gift**, so the villager can still be gifted that day on top of the gift intro boost. As all villagers dislike weeds, this is commonly called a **weed intro**, since it is easiest to perform with a weed, but other items will work depending on the villager.

## Gifts

### Forageables

The standard gift boost in StH is +4. There are very few disliked gifts, so most gifts will give either +2, +4, or +6 (with some exceptions, like Parsley). Forageables are the quickest and best gifts, so they are the go-to strategy in any%, but detailed gift charts can be found here (INSERT LINK). Some basic data on forageable boosts for every villager can be found below.

| Villager | Berry | Herb | M. Herb | Flower | Walnut | Mushroom |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Bob | +4 | +4 | +4 | +0 | +2 | +2 |
| Dia | +4<sup>1</sup> | +4 | +4 | +0 | +2 | +2 |
| Flak | +4 | +4 | +4 | +0 | +3 | +6 |
| Gina | +4 | +4 | +4 | +4 | +2 | +2 |
| Gwen | +4<sup>2</sup> | +4 | +4 | +4 | +2 | +2 |
| Joe | +4 | +4 | +4 | +0 | +2 | +2 |
| Katie | +4 | +4 | +4 | +4 | +2 | +2 |
| Kurt | +4 | +4 | +4 | +4 | +4 | +4 |
| Louis | +4 | +4 | +4 | +0 | +2 | +2 |
| Lyla | +4 | +4 | +2 | +4<sup>3</sup> | +2 | +2 |
| Martha | +4 | +4 | +2 | +4 | +2 | +2 |
| Nak | +4 | +4 | +4 | +0 | +3 | +6 |
| Nic | +4 | +4 | +4 | +0 | +3 | +6 |
| Parsley | +3<sup>4</sup> | +3<sup>5</sup> | +3<sup>5</sup> | +0 | +3<sup>6</sup> | +3<sup>6</sup> |
| Ronald | +4 | +4 | +4 | +0 | +2 | +2 |
| Tim | +4 | +4 | +4 | +0 | +2 | +2 |
| Wallace | +4 | +4 | +4 | +0 | +2 | +2 |
| Woody | +4 | +4 | +4 | +0 | +2 | +2 |

Note: Berry = Very Berry, Blueberry, Cranberry; M. Herb = Medicinal Herb; Flower = Moondrop Flower, Pink-Cat-Mint Flower

<sup>1</sup> +6 from Blueberry if AP > 40;
<sup>2</sup> +6 from Cranberry;
<sup>3</sup> +6 from Pink-Cat-Mint Flower;
<sup>4</sup> +4 from all berries if AP > 20;
<sup>5</sup> +6 if AP > 20;
<sup>6</sup> +2 if AP > 20

An important gift mechanic in StH is the **affection threshold**; for some villagers, the boost from a certain gift will change depending on their current affection value, and this can be crucial for some endings. The most notable case is Dia, who receives a +4 boost from Blueberries at first, but when her affection is greater than 40, they give +6, which greatly reduces the number of trips needed to gift her for the Treasure Hunt II ending. In some cases, the boost can even decrease at higher affection levels, such as Parsley's boost from Walnuts and Mushrooms, which decreases from +3 to +2 when his affection exceeds 20.

### Birthdays

Birthdays can sometimes play a role in StH runs, but the birthday boost is not static across all gifts, or all villagers.

### Ending-specific boosts

Gift boosts can sometimes be affected by the player's progress through a certain ending. This is not well-documented, but a notable example is Cake Contest, where Katie receives +7 instead of her normal +6 from the Golden Egg and Golden Milk after giving her the cake recipe.

## Practical Applications

In routing singular any% endings and All Endings any%, the Goddess questions are the first place to start. The strategy is to give the response pattern that will boost whatever villager is the main target for the ending being attempted, e.g., for any% Horse Race, the **positive** pattern can be used to boost Bob, for any% Endangered Weasel, the **mixed** pattern can be used to boost Gwen, etc. In cases where multiple villagers must be gifted, it's best to get the Goddess boost for the villager that will end up requiring the most gifts. The only cases in any% where both target villagers belong to the same response pattern are Cake Contest and Goddess Dress, where Katie and Gina both get +15 for the **negative** pattern and are involved in each other's endings.
