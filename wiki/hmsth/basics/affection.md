# StH Affection

The affection system in StH is similar to other early HM titles, but it also has its fair share of intricacies, especially regarding the conversation system. This page will cover the basics of **introduction**, **conversation**, and **gift** boosts, as well as affection boosts from the **Harvest Goddess questions** and certain **cutscenes**.

## Goddess Questions

Upon starting any fresh file (by selecting "New Game" on the title screen), a cutscene with the Harvest Goddess will play where she tasks the player with saving the town. In this cutscene, she will ask three questions, each with a **positive** response and a **negative** response. These questions are:

  1. "A puppy has been abandoned in the rain. What would you do?"
     * Take him home (POSITIVE)
     * Ignore (NEGATIVE)
  2. "Someone has thrown trash on the ground. What would you do?"
     * Pick up (POSITIVE)
     * Ignore (NEGATIVE)
  3. "You've found someone else's money on the ground. What would you do?"
     * Turn it in (POSITIVE)
     * Take it home (NEGATIVE)

The **positive** response is always the first option, the **negative** always the second. Depending on the player's responses to these questions, a **+15 affection boost** will be given to each of a different group of villagers. This boost only applies to the first year of the file, as the opening Goddess cutscene does not play for any subsequent New Game+ years. The response patterns are **all positive**, **all negative**, or **mixed** (any combination of at least one positive and at least one negative response). The villager groups are as follows:

  * POSITIVE: Dia, Bob, Nak, Kurt, Louis
  * NEGATIVE: Katie, Gina, Nic, Joe
  * MIXED: Lyla, Gwen, Tim, Flak

Wallace, Woody, Ronald, Parsley, and Martha are not affected by any response pattern, so they always start with 0 affection.

Because the Goddess questions are only available on a fresh file, they can only be used in any% speedruns. The strategy is to give the response pattern that will boost whatever villager is the main target for the ending being attempted, e.g., for any% Horse Race, the **positive** pattern can be used to boost Bob, for any% Endangered Weasel, the **mixed** pattern can be used to boost Gwen, etc.

## Introductions

An **introduction** is the first interaction with a given villager in a given year. Because New Game+ "resets the timeline" in StH, all villagers will start again at 0 affection and treat the player as if they had never met. The introduction boost varies for every villager and can also vary depending on whether the player is holding an item during this first interaction, called a **gift intro**. The introduction boosts of all villagers are given below.
