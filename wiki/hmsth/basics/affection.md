# StH Affection

The affection system in StH is similar to other early HM titles, but it also has its fair share of intricacies, especially regarding the conversation system. This page will cover the basics of **introduction**, **conversation**, and **gift** boosts, as well as affection boosts from the **Harvest Goddess questions** and certain **cutscenes**.

## Goddess Questions

Upon starting any fresh file (by selecting "New Game" on the title screen), a cutscene with the Harvest Goddess will play where she tasks the player with saving the town. In this cutscene, she will ask three questions, each with a **positive** response and a **negative** response. These questions are:

  1. "A puppy has been abandoned in the rain. What would you do?"
     * Take him home (POSITIVE)
     * Ignore (NEGATIVE)
  2. "Someone has thrown trash on the ground. What would you do?"
     * Pick up (POSITIVE)
     * Ignore (NEGATIVE)
  3. "You've found someone else's money on the ground. What would you do?"
     * Turn it in (POSITIVE)
     * Take it home (NEGATIVE)
