# Gift Charts

This page provides gift charts for every villager, covering every possible gift in the game. A separate gift chart is provided for the birthday gift boosts for each villager. Charts assume no cutscenes have taken place, so they are the "default" boosts for every gift. Villagers are given in alphabetical order.
