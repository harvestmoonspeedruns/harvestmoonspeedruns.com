# Harvest Moon Speedruns

Welcome to the home of guides and tools for the Harvest Moon speedrunning community! We compete to
be the fastest farmers, spouses, collectors, and sometimes sleepers in our small farming towns.
These runs consist of percise movements, quick menuing, some good-old-fashion RNG, and vast
knowledge of NPC schedules, backup routes, and what happens on what day. We hope you find enjoyment
watching, running, or just researching these amazing games.
